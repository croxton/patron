# Installation / Upgrading

### Option 1: Composer
Composer is a simple, straight forward installation.  Simple run the following command in your project root:

```bash
composer require flipboxfactory/patron
```

&nbsp;

### Option 2: Plugin Store
Within your Craft CMS project admin panel, navigate to the 'Plugin Store' and search for `Patron`.  Installation
is a button click away.

Once the plugin is installed, head over to [Configure] the plugin.

[Configure]: ../configure "Configure - General Settings"
