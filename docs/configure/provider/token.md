# Configure Provider Token

Tokens are issued by the third-party provider.  A token is issued by a provider, therefore it cannot be edited.  However, it is possible to manage the associated environment(s).

Here are some terminology guidelines:

### `Access Token`
An identifier provided to you from a third party provider and used for authentication.

### `Refresh Token (optional)`
An alternate identifier used to issue a new Access Token (when expired, etc). 

### `Environments`
The environment(s) the Provider Token is configured for.
